# NitroxBuildsEarly
The Subnautica Nitrox mod is under the GPL License and I do not own it, If anything illegal is being done here, be sure to notify me in the issues tab.

# What is this?
This is a repo where I post my builds of Nitrox that were compiled using Visual Studio Community Edition 2022 on Windows 11 24H2.

# Why does this exist?
To lower waits on the newest features of Nitrox for those who want to conserve space on their computer (VS 22 takes a chunk,) or otherwise don't want to have to troubleshoot things by themselves.

# What versions are these?
Well currently I am compiling builds of 1.8, specifically the main branch on the official repo.

# Are you affiliated with the SubnauticaNitrox dev team?
No. I did make an issue about Linux troubles at some point though.

# Does this work on Linux?
I haven't figured that one out yet. If you know how to, I'd love to be told how.
